# MoveFunsDAO has completed the verification node setup and connected to the Sui permanent testnet

## Part.1

Why can one become a validator node?

"MoveFuns is a DAO for Move developers, aiming to maintain basic libraries for Move's cross-chain ecosystem, promote and popularize the Move language, and create related educational videos and organize events for the Move cross-chain ecosystem. It is a digital-world public welfare DAO entity.

MoveFuns has now become an influential Sui Move community, with a large number of Sui Move enthusiasts. Through collaborative learning and the LearnToEarn project's "Starship Program," developers are encouraged to join Move learning and continuously contribute to the Move ecosystem with their development and open-source contributions.

## Part.2

Why is it necessary to become a validator node?

MoveFuns is a digital-world public welfare DAO entity that operates without profit as its primary goal, and any earnings generated belong to the DAO to maintain its operations.

Now that MoveFuns has become a validator node, it will help incentivize the community to produce Sui Move educational articles and videos, as well as improve various aspects of the Move ecosystem. This not only affirms the contribution of MoveFuns to the Sui community but also greatly encourages community members. It is also a crucial step towards the decentralization of the Sui network.
